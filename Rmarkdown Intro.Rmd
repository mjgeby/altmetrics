This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r car_summary}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r car plot, echo = FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

What are the dimensions of **cars**:
The number of cars is `r dim(cars)[1]`.

```{r cars dimensions, include = "FALSE"}
dim(cars)
```

Above, I have hidden both results and code by incanting 'include = FALSE'.
